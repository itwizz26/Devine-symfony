# Devine: Part 1 (symfony)

This is part 1 of two eco systems that are integrated for demonstration purposes.

This is a PHP 8, MySQL 10 and Symfony 6.

## Setup

Now in your terminal, inside the root directory, 
run this command to install all the necessary modules.

```bash
composer install
```
Update the MySQL details inside /.env to match your own.

## Testing the application

Spin up the application using Symfony's built-in PHP server 
```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public
```
and open [localhost]
(http://127.0.0.1:8080)

Now you need to follow the steps in the second part of this demo series.
